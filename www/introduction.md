# Introduction

**Forsta** is a design system for building robust, functional UIs that are straight forward to use.

The name comes from the swedish word _förstå_, which means "to understand". The principle goal of the Forsta system is to create software that can be easily well understood.

One of the goals of Forsta is to achieve a system that allows developers to create software without having to make decisions about how the user interface should look.

The limitations Forsta imposes should remove the vast majority of decisions about design and interaction.

## Scope

Forsta is primarily a system that focuses on web applications but its principles and idea can be carried into platforms and domains.
